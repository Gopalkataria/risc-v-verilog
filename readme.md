# RISC-V Sequential Implementation

This project is a sequential implementation of the RISC-V architecture. The implementation is divided into five stages, each represented by its respective file.

## Stages

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**
    - responsible for fetching the instruction from memory using the program counter (PC).

2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**
    - decodes the fetched instruction and reads the necessary registers.

3. **Execution (EX)**
    - performs arithmetic and logical operations based on the decoded instruction.

4. **Memory Access (MEM)**
    - handles memory read and write operations.

5. **Write Back (WB)**
    - writes the result of the execution or memory access back to the register file.
